                    This chapter unravels different outlooks on education from notable thinkers. My takeaways are
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>John Locke</b> is an empiricist, highlighting the acquisition of experiences from the five senses.</li>
                    <li><b>Herbert Spencer</b> is more on utility—that is, usage of something—putting 'survival' as the focal point of education.</li>
                    <li><b>John Dewey</b>, a pragmatic and progressivist thinker, believed in democracy, experiential knowledge, and learner-centered theory.</li>
                    <li><b>George Counts</b> is onto the notion of change. Schools are vehicles of change and equality.</li>
                    <li><b>Theodore Brameld</b> pointed out fairness and social reform as the pioneering view of education.</li>
                    <li><b>Paulo Freire</b> advocates deprecating the banking method. A school must be an open book for dialogue.</li>

                    Schooling is a social function. Hence education is a social process, too. This chapter elaborates on three major theories in social science that imply education.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <b>Structural-Functional Theory</b> views society as an interconnected whole—each part having its unique function—that works together for balance and stability.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Conflict Theory</b> puts conflict as the driving force of society. When conflicts occur, change duly happens. And for society to progress, change must happen. This process manifests naturally.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Symbolic Interactionists Theory</b> regards symbols as social cues with varying meanings. Different people view symbols uniquely. And, over time, these meanings change as people interact. Essentially, society is driven by the cues we make.</li>
                </ul>

                    School is a sanctuary of the history and culture of people, reflected in the school’s philosophy, mission, and vision. Things to note include
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The school and community are mutually correlated—each benefits one other.</li>
                    <li>Communities aid schools through Brigada Eskwela, Youth Development Programs, and Community Service. That is, schools implement many community projects, too, by sharing classrooms and facilities for meetings, events, or as evacuation centers.</li>
                    <li>In a functionalist view, schools perform their function to stabilize society. The school reflects what society needs, preserves, and visions.</li>
                    <li>
                        Laws support school-community partnerships as well. <b>Republic Act 9155</b>, Governance of the Basic Education Act, Section 3F states

                    The Code of Ethics for Professional Teachers lays out the foundation of do’s and don’ts in the professional practice of teaching. The following are some qualities a professional teacher should possess.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Facilitator</b>. Teachers ought to make learning easier. They should be able to break down complex topics into simple ones while still making learning enjoyable in the process.</li>
                    <li><b>Leader</b>. Teachers are not only bound to the classroom. They are initiators of leadership. They are expected to participate in the community and practice their own rights.</li>
                    <li><b>Role Model</b>. Teachers are granted innate social recognition. They are expected to behave with honor and dignity at all times.</li>
                    <li><b>Open-minded</b>. Teachers must respect the culture, tradition, and beliefs of the community and must be sympathetic to the local customs.</li>
                    <li><b>Informant</b>. Teachers ought to aid the school in disseminating information for school projects, activities, memorandums, etc. to the community.</li>
                    <li><b>Collaborator</b>. Teachers are no lone creatures. They are expected to maintain a harmonious personal and professional relationship with the community and other stakeholders. </li>

                    To be a leader is no easy role. It is a heavy but fulfilling duty at the same time. Organizational leadership is not limited to leading itself. It requires the leader in a work ethic that empowers individuals equally while working towards the goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A leader and a manager are different from one another. A manager is focused on achieving a working goal. A leader innovates and empowers people to achieve their goals. There are also types of leadership styles.

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Autocratic leaders</b> are authoritarian. They do decision-making by themselves.</li>
                    <li><b>Consultative leaders</b> tend to consult the members before making a decision.</li>
                    <li><b>Democratic leaders</b> put the majority as the basis of a decision.</li>
                    <li><b>Laissez-faire leaders</b> follow a pseudo-tolerant style where participation is individual.</li>
                    <li><b>Situational leaders</b> are rather adaptive and quick-thinking in decision-making.</li>
                    <li><b>Servant leaders</b> put themselves in a “servant” role to their members.</li>
