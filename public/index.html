                Welcome to my online collection of educational resources. This site is dedicated to providing clear and comprehensive notes on pre-collegiate Mathematics. Here, you'll find study guides, practice exercises, and additional resources designed to enhance your learning experience.

            <p>
                So, to honor this ground, ponder the question below:

                <p>How do we address students at a disadvantage/disability in a classroom setting?</p>

                <h1>Assessment</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>Assessment</b> refers to the variety of methods or tools teachers use to evaluate, measure, or document students’ academic readiness, learning progress, skill acquisition, or educational needs.
                </p>
                <slidedown-box title="How do we classify assessment?">
                    <p>Classifications of assessment include but are not limited to the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Pre-assessments</b> (or <b>diagnostic assessments</b>) – are administered before students begin a lesson, unit, course, or academic program.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Formative assessments</b> – are in-process evaluations of student learning that are typically administered multiple times during a unit, course, or academic program.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Summative assessments</b> – are used to evaluate student learning after a specific instructional period—typically at the end of a unit, course, semester, program, or school year. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Placement assessments</b> – are used to “place” students into a course, course level, or academic program.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Screening assessments</b> – determine whether students need specialized assistance or services or are ready to begin a course, grade level, or academic program.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </slidedown-box>
                <p>
                    Moreover, another classification of assessments is by their purpose (i.e., assessment <i>of</i> learning, assessment <i>for</i> learning, and assessment <i>as</i> learning).

                <p>
                    <b>Learning resources</b> are any resource–print and non-print materials–and online/open-access resources which support and enhance–directly or indirectly–learning and teaching.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These may include <b>printed or digital materials</b> (textbooks, flashcards, computer software), <b>tools, equipment, and aids</b> (chalkboard, computer, projector), and <b>facilities</b> (classroom, school gym, science/computer laboratory).

                <slidedown-box title="What about the learning resources for disabled students?">
                    <p>We have specialized learning formats that include but are not limited to the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Braille</b> is a system of reading and writing through touch, made up of raised dot patterns for letters, numbers, and punctuation marks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Large prints</b> are hard copies that are larger than the standard ones. Sometimes there may be extra white space for students having difficulty focusing on the text.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Audio formats</b> provide information through recorded or non-recorded speech. These may include synthesized electronic speech spoken by a computer or other device.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Digital text</b> presents information through text, audio, images, or even any combination of these. Some are modified to address students having difficulty seeing colors.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    <b>Instructional accommodations</b> change the student’s way of accessing academic content or progressing through the same learning goal. Note that these accommodations don’t change the standards a student is trying to achieve/accomplish.

                <p>
                    Lee (2022) delved deeper and devised different accommodation types:
