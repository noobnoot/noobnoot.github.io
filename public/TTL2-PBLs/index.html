                Education significantly changed as we entered the 21st century, leading to new student needs that teachers must consider. This shift, often called the <b>paradigm shift</b>, introduced new approaches to how teachers should facilitate learning. One attractive aspect of this change is the focus on <b>active learning</b> (also known as <b>experiential learning</b> in some literature).
            </p>
            <p>
                Approaches in active learning focus on "learners' engagement in activities that are geared towards the creation of knowledge or making meaning to existing knowledge while developing their 21st Century skills" (Espique & Ayao-Ao, 2020). Active learning involves teaching-learning processes such as <b>Inquiry-based Learning</b>, <b>Research-based Learning</b>, <b>Problem-based Learning</b>, and <b>Project-based Learning</b>.

            <h1>Nature of Problem-Based and Project-Based Approaches</h1>

            <p>As authentic types of experiential learning, problem-based and project-based learning share many similarities. Larmer (2015) enumerated that their nature is inherently <b>outcome-based</b>, starting with <b>open-ended questions or tasks</b>.</p>

            <slidedown-box title="What do we mean by open-ended questions or tasks?">
                <p>Open-ended questions or tasks do not have one correct answer and typically require more elaborate responses or solutions. They invite creativity and critical thinking from the students (Will to Teach, n.d.).</p>
            </slidedown-box>

            <p>Well-created problem-based and project-based tasks provide learning outcomes that promote student independence and inquiry through <b>self-directed learning</b> (Espique & Ayao-Ao, 2020). Although both approaches take longer to facilitate and are more multifaceted than traditional ones, they provide more authentic applications of content and skills.</p>

            <slidedown-box title="What are the differences between problem-based and project-based learning?">
                
                <p>Although problem-based and project-based approaches share many attractive similarities, the two have subtle yet notable differences, especially in their outcomes.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In <b>project-based learning</b>, students produce a comprehensive product or performance demonstrating their content mastery. Here, students usually start with a <b>prototype</b> of the solution.</li>
                    <li> In <b>problem-based learning</b>, students must present a solution to a clearly defined authentic problem. Here, students start with a <b>hypothesis</b> of the solution.</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Designing Problem-Based and Project-Based Tasks</h1>

            <p>Of course, creating and implementing a project-based and problem-based task is a challenging task. Developing one requires careful planning and hands-on teaching experience. By this, the sections below provide subtle suggestions that can be used to develop effective ones.</p>

            <slidedown-box title="Designing a Problem-Based Learning Task">
                
                <p>Spaces for Learning (n.d.) suggested the following steps in a problem-based approach. The items below summarize them.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Choose a competency and identify intended learning outcomes. It must question what students will know and be able to do after the task.</li>
                    <li>Design an authentic scenario or issue with an embedded problem. It must be motivating, engaging, and generating good discussion.</li>
                    <li>Define the problem precisely. It must answer what the students should answer or solve.</li>
                    <li>Initiate research and inquiry that grant students hints or data to solve the problem. It can be done through brainstorming (for groups), mini-survey, reading, or even Internet browsing. Students must develop a hypothesis along the way.</li>
                    <li>Make students present their solutions (written or orally) and evaluate them with well-defined criteria or constructive feedback.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Leader in Me (2018) provided some steps to start with project-based learning in a classroom. We compressed the steps as follows.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Start by selecting a competency under a targeted national standard. Prioritize those that use higher-order project-based verbs such as "create," "design," or "demonstrate."</li>
                    <li>Create an essential question or situation. It must be comprehensive and flexible at the same time.</li>
                    <li>Develop criteria that will show evidence of the learning targets.</li>
                    <li>Plan a way to provide ongoing feedback as students create their project-based tasks.</li>
                    <li>Make sure students have a way to share their learning (or their prototype) in the process. Their learning must align respectively with the selected competency or standard.</li>
                </ol>

        <article header="Conclusion">

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>

            <p>It is widely accepted that problem-based and project-based learning is a learner-centered educational strategy in which students authentically explore and learn about a subject (Thomas, 2000). Altogether, the benefits cultivated in PPBL are as follows.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>They foster the studentsâ€™ independence (Espique & Ayao-Ao, 2020).</li>
                <li>They develop students' delegation, quality standards, and goal-setting abilities (Method Schools Team, 2017).</li>
                <li>They encourage student interaction and communication (Girdhar & Malik, 2018).</li>
                <li>They develop the student's <b>critical thinking</b> and <b>creativity skills</b> (Colley, 2008).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>To conclude, here are some examples of PPBL tasks from other literature that might spark inspiration.</p>

            <slidedown-box title="Examples of Problem-Based Tasks">
                
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Show a video clip about different climates across the Earth. Ask them about the advantages and disadvantages of each climate zone and why certain places only have two or four seasons.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>As a project about right triangles, ask your students to create an example situation or scenario in which the Pythagorean theorem can be used. They can present their work in writing or oral discussions.</li>
                    <li>Present examples of fouls in basketball or volleyball clips from a sports channel or film. Then, make your students identify what kind of foul it is and why it is a foul.</li>
                </ol>

                        <p>Students work as architects and design a bridge scaffolding using popsicle sticks and tape. A board of adults or teachers will score each student's scaffold using pre-defined criteria.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li>Make your students select and identify fake news across social media and the Internet. They must create a poster, brochure, or banner that justifies why it is fake or not credible. Let them present and discuss their work in front of the class.</li>
                    <li>Students work as dancers to develop their style of two (2) minutes of Zumba. Let them choose their theme, music, and costume to maximize the task's creative affinity.</li>
