                Objectives are essential to instructional design as they provide a clear roadmap for designing and delivering curriculum. Thus, teachers must know how to write and classify lesson objectives to help them select appropriate teaching methods, assessment strategies, and use instructional materials. After all, assessing learning outcomes is one of the functions of a teacher.

                <h1>Standard-Based Assessment</h1>
                <p>
                    A <b>standard</b> acts as a benchmark for learning that defines what students need to know.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Standards-based assessment lets students know against which criteria you will judge their work, and the standards attached to each of these criteria. It tells students what performance is required and allows you to gain a sense of how your students are doing overall, based on their achievement of the standards.
                </p>

                <h1>Constructive Alignment</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>Constructive alignment</b> by Biggs & Tang (2011) is a principle that you can use to shape your education. Constructive alignment is about purposefully connecting learning objectives, learning activities, and assessments with one another. The goal of this triangular relationship is to make sure all aspects of education work towards the same objective.

                    In line with implementing the <b>Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act No. 10533)</b>, the Department of Education adopted the enclosed <b>Policy Guidelines on Classroom Assessment for the K to 12 Basic Education Program (DO No. 8, S. 2015)</b>.

                    <p>
                        At the heart of this assessment framework is the recognition and deliberate consideration of the learners' <b>zone of proximal development</b> (Vygotsky, 1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, ensuring the learners' success in moving from guided to independent display of knowledge, understanding, and skills are features of this framework along with the development of learners' higher-order thinking skills and 21st-century skills.

                    According to the policy guideline, assessment in the classroom is aimed at helping students perform well with the learning materials. Learning materials comprise of <b>content standards</b>, <b>performance standards</b>, and <b>learning competencies</b> outlined in the curriculum.

                <h1>Types of Assessment</h1>
                <p>In a broad sense, we consider assessment into these essential types:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Formative Assessment</b> refers to various methods teachers use to conduct in-process evaluations of student comprehension, learning needs, and academic progress during a lesson, unit, or course.</li>
                    <li><b>Summative Assessments</b> are administered at the end of an instructional unit in a course. These assessments evaluate student learning by comparing performance to a standard or benchmark.</li>
                    <li><b>Diagnostic Assessment</b> evaluates students' strengths, weaknesses, knowledge, and skills before instruction or at the beginning of a unit, lesson, quarter, or period. </li>
                    <li><b>Placement Assessment</b> is usually done at the beginning of the school year to determine what a student, especially a new student, already know in order to test their eligibility or to place them in the right class.</li>
                    <li><b>Traditional Assessment</b> refers to standardized testing that uses testing questions with a limited number of answer choices (generally close-ended). It includes multiple choice, true or false, and short responses.</li>
                    <li><b>Authentic Assessment</b> refers to integrating learning and assessments to ensure that student's needs are being met. Authentic assessment is where students thoughtfully apply their acquired skills to a new situation or environment.</li>

                <h1>Competencies, Objectives, Outcomes</h1>
                <p>
                    Of course, before we devise appropriate targets (i.e., instructional objectives), we must know and differentiate the basic terms concerning this. As stated by Hartel and Foegeding (2004),
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A <b>competency</b> is a general statement detailing the desired knowledge and skills of students graduating from a subject, course, or program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An <b>objective</b> is a very general (or very specific, e.g., in a lesson plan) statement about the larger goals of the subject, course, or program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An <b>outcome</b> is a very specific statement that describes exactly what a student can do in some measurable way. A competency may have several specific learning outcomes so a course or subject typically contains more outcomes than competencies.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Learning Domains and Taxonomies</h1>
                <p>
                    There are three main domains of learning that all teachers should know and use in constructing instructional objectives: cognitive (knowledge), affective (values), and psychomotor (skills) domain.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The <b>cognitive domain</b> involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes recall and recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the development of intellectual abilities and skills. Two taxonomies are strongly associated with this domain:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bloom's Taxonomy (Bloom et al., 1964) and</li>
                            <li>Revised Bloom's Taxonomy (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The figure below highlights the subtle yet impactful difference between the two taxonomies.
                        </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <b>affective domain</b> includes objectives pertaining to attitudes, appreciation, values, and emotion. Krathwol's affective domain (see Table 4) is ordered  according to the principle of <b>internalization</b>—a process whereby a person's affect toward an object passes from a general awareness level to a point where it could guide, change, or control behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <b>psychomotor domain</b> is characterized by the progressive levels of behaviors from observation to mastery of physical skills. Simpson (1972) includes physical movement, coordination, and the use of motor-skill areas as integral parts of this domain (see Table 5 for these levels).

                <p>
                    While Bloom's Taxonomy has been quite useful in extending learning from simply remembering to more complex cognitive structures, fewer models have come along.

                        <p>One model that might prove more useful is the <b>Structure of Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy</b> (Bigg's & Collis, 1982). It is a model that describes levels of increasing complexity in a learner's understanding of subjects.</p>

                            <p>The model consists of five levels in order of understanding.</p>

                            <b>Marzano's A New Taxonomy of Educational Objectives</b> (Marzano & Kendall, 2007) incorporates a wider range of factors that affect how students think. It also provides a more research-based theory to help teachers improve their students' thinking.

                            Manzano's taxonomy is made up of three systems the <b>Knowledge Domain</b> working together. The three systems are the <b>Self-System</b>, the <b>Metacognitive System</b>, and the <b>Cognitive System</b>.

                            To see how these work together, consider the example situation below.

                                Currently, Pedro is in his Math class with his teacher discussing the lesson. He hears his classmates talking about the latest episode of the live-action version of One Piece. However, since the lesson is critical for the periodical exam,
                            </p>

                                <li>
                                    his <b>Metacognitive System</b> tells him to pay attention and ask questions during the discussion;

                    We use the term '<i>unpacking</i>' as a technique teachers can use to make sense of standards and then create focused learning targets to make them actionable. This process, also called “deconstructing” or “unwrapping” standards, fosters collaborative dialogue that supports growth and effectiveness.

                    <li>
                        Analyze and make connections between signal words. It should answer, "What does the standard/competency target?"
