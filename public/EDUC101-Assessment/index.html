                Assessments play a fundamental role in facilitating classroom inclusion. It helps educators distinguish not just student needs but also what accommodation to consider for the disadvantaged ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, to honor this ground, ponder the question below:

            <slidedown-box header="Question to Ponder:">
                <p>How do we address students at a disadvantage/disability in a classroom setting?</p>

                <p>
                    <b>Assessment</b> refers to the variety of methods or tools teachers use to evaluate, measure, or document students’ academic readiness, learning progress, skill acquisition, or educational needs.
                </p>
                <slidedown-box header="How do we classify assessment?">
                    <p>Classifications of assessment include but are not limited to the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Pre-assessments</b> (or <b>diagnostic assessments</b>) – are administered before students begin a lesson, unit, course, or academic program.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Formative assessments</b> – are in-process evaluations of student learning that are typically administered multiple times during a unit, course, or academic program.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Summative assessments</b> – are used to evaluate student learning after a specific instructional period—typically at the end of a unit, course, semester, program, or school year. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Placement assessments</b> – are used to “place” students into a course, course level, or academic program.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Screening assessments</b> – determine whether students need specialized assistance or services or are ready to begin a course, grade level, or academic program.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </slidedown-box>
                <p>
                    Moreover, another classification of assessments is by their purpose (i.e., assessment <i>of</i> learning, assessment <i>for</i> learning, and assessment <i>as</i> learning).

                <p>
                    <b>Learning resources</b> are any resource–print and non-print materials–and online/open-access resources which support and enhance–directly or indirectly–learning and teaching.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These may include <b>printed or digital materials</b> (textbooks, flashcards, computer software), <b>tools, equipment, and aids</b> (chalkboard, computer, projector), and <b>facilities</b> (classroom, school gym, science/computer laboratory).

                    <p>We have specialized learning formats that include but are not limited to the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Braille</b> is a system of reading and writing through touch, made up of raised dot patterns for letters, numbers, and punctuation marks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Large prints</b> are hard copies that are larger than the standard ones. Sometimes there may be extra white space for students having difficulty focusing on the text.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Audio formats</b> provide information through recorded or non-recorded speech. These may include synthesized electronic speech spoken by a computer or other device.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Digital text</b> presents information through text, audio, images, or even any combination of these. Some are modified to address students having difficulty seeing colors.
