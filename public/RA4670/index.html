                The <b>Magna Carta for Public School Teachers</b>, also known as <b>Republic Act No. 4670</b>, outlines the professional rights and protections that our public school teachers are entitled to in light of the demands and degree of difficulty involved in their profession. It was approved in <b>1966</b> and composed of 7 chapters and 35 sections.

            <slidedown-box header="Hold on. What is the Magna Carta?">
                <p>
                    <b>Magna Carta</b>, which means <b>'The Great Charter,’</b> is legal writing that establishes the rights and privileges of an entity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term came from Europe when King John of England signed a charter of liberties as a countermeasure to the threat of civil war.
