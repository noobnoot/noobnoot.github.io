        <p><b>6:32 PM. June 23, 2025.</b></p>
        <p>after reading this, please keep it to yourself. <b>don’t share it with others, not even your own classmates.</b> this is a personal letter from me, your adviser.</p> 
        <p>the time you read this, we’re already three out of eight months in, St. Raphael. i’m writing this way way ahead of time to pause and recognize you.</p>
        <p>as your adviser and a close observer of you, i want to leave you with four personal regrets... lessons i wish someone told me in life. before we part ways, i hope at least one of them stays with you.</p> 
        <p>for now, here’s the first one.</p>
        <p>1: room.</p>
        <p>the first regret i learned was: effort not shown is effort not celebrated. this world usually cares about results, not the struggles behind them.</p>
        <p>but as i grew older…</p>
        <p>i realized that wasn’t completely true.</p>
        <p>there is always one and only person who knows the whole story...</p>
        <p>so you know how much you’ve pushed yourself. the nights you traded for mornings. the doubts you carried but moved past anyway. even when the applause was missing, you were still there as your own witness.</p>
        <p>and i think that matters...</p>
        <p>so when it seems like the world overlooks your effort, don’t let it take you. keep a record of your growth in your own, and let that be your sand.</p>
        <p>awards may bring recognition, but effort, seen or unseen, builds you that no one can take away.</p>
        <p>TL;DR: don’t just celebrate your achievements. celebrate the person you’ve been becoming all along. you are your only own witness that you can truly rely on.</p>
        <p>— sir J</p>
