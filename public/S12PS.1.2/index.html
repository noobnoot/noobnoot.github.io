                Did you know that the calcium in your bones and the iron in your blood were made in exploding stars? This means that the elements in your body—carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and more—once lived in the star’s core.

            <p>
                All the matter in the universe, from the smallest grain of sand to the largest stars, originated from elements formed in cosmic events through nucleosynthesis.

                <p>In the beginning, there was a burst of extreme energy and a billion degrees Celsius of heat—the <b>Big Bang</b>. The universe soon expanded rapidly, filled with a thick cloud of subatomic particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons.</p>
                <p>As the universe cooled just enough, protons and neutrons began to collide and stick together, forming the simplest, light elements like hydrogen, helium, and lithium. We call this process the <b>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</b>.</p>

                <p>When stars begin fusing iron, they gradually lose their internal energy. This makes the star weaker. When it can no longer support itself, it dies and explodes as a <b>supernova</b>.</p>
