                The entire globe has evolved into a global community. We have joined the global community as citizens. What happens in one area of the world, no matter far away, impacts us. According to a song, “it’s a tiny world, after all.” And it is hoped that we are able to propose solutions to these global problems.
            </p>
            <p>So, to honor this ground, ponder by the question below:</p>
            <slidedown-box header="Question to Ponder:">
                <p>As an educator, how would you devise a hypothetical solution to the problems we face today?</p>

            <p>Refer to the following premise below:</p>
            <boxed-quote>
                <p>
                    Say you happened to die suddenly in a terrible accident in a world plagued by problems like climate change, pollution, violence, terrorism, and corruption. You wished to change something, even a tiny difference. But it all ended too soon.

                Assuming reincarnation is real, which of the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) would you wish to see solved in your next life, and why?

                            Global temperatures are rising, and by 2100, they are expected to rise from 2.6 degrees Celsius to 4.8 degrees Celsius. This would result in more severe weather, food, and resource shortages, and disease transmission.

                                To put it simply, global warming causes climate change.

                            Ocean trash, pesticides, and fertilizers, as well as air, light, and noise pollution, are all examples of such. Clean water is vital for humans and animals, but more than a billion do not have access to it because of harmful chemicals, unmaintained sewages, industrial wastes, etc.

                            In terms of “bullying” in the country, we have the RA 10627, or the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013, to address these issues in schools.

                        <h3>Security and Well-Being</h3>
                        <p>
                            This involves the safety of an individual in their homes, the proximity of healthcare to people, etc. The United Nations began a momentum on abolishing issues involving these. International treaties, agreements, and pacts—to name a few.

                            <p>
                                As Muston (2022) stated, “students who do not feel safe at school—either emotionally or physically—are more distracted and less successful than their peers. School safety and student achievement are connected; it’s hard to have one without the other.”

                            More than 72 million children of primary education age around the world remain unschooled due to marginalization, poverty, financial deficit, and inequality (Humanium.org, 2018).

                        <h3>Unemployment</h3>
                        <p>
                            Many people, particularly those aged 15 to 24, struggle to obtain work and provide a decent living for themselves and their families. This results in a scarcity of essential resources such as food, clothes, transportation, and adequate living circumstances.

                        <h3>Government Corruption</h3>
                        <p>
                            Graft, bribery, embezzlement, backdoor deals, nepotism, and favoritism are all examples of corruption. As a major source of poverty, corruption disproportionately affects the poor, undermining political and economic growth, democracy, and other aspects of life. As of Transparency International’s 2013 corruption ranking, the Philippines stood at 94th among 177 nations (Moss, 2014).

                            It is the “harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs” (WHO, 2021).

                            As the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (2022) indicated, “around 284 million people aged 15-64 used drugs worldwide in 2020, a 26 percent increase over the previous decade.” And in the Philippines, the prevalence of drug use is 2.05%, equivalent to 1.7 million Filipinos (UN Philippines, 2021.)

                            As the OHCHR (n.d.) implied, terrorism “involves the intimidation or coercion of populations or governments through the threat or perpetration of violence, causing death, serious injury or the taking of hostages.” It diminishes the public's sense of security and threatens democracy. Schools are one of the hotspots of these attacks.

                            <p>
                                The study by Wansink et. al. (2021) revealed that teachers should first initiate a safe, calm classroom environment while monitoring students’ reactions. Teachers should also provide accurate information and help them make sense of what is happening in a neutral, coherent narration. And finally, and most importantly, listen and abide by the instructions of authorities.

                    In September 2015, The General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which includes 17 SDGs. Building on the principle of “leaving no one behind,” the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development (UN News, 2015).
