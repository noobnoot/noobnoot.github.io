            <p>Carbohydrates like glycogen stored in our bodies are considered a short-term energy source. For longer-term options, we store our energy in <b>fats</b>. And in biochemistry, we collectively call them <b>lipids</b>.</p>

                    <b>Lipids</b>, from the Greek word “lipos,” meaning “fats,” are non-polymer biological molecules known for their insolubility in water. Similar to carbohydrates, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen compose lipids.

            <p>
                Besides storing long-term energy, lipids insulate our bodies against the cold and form the plasma membranes of our cells. They also cushion vital organs, act as chemical messengers in the form of hormones, and help the body absorb fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).

                    Most lipids are built from <b>fatty acids</b>, long chains of carbon and hydrogen with a carboxyl group (–COOH) at one end.

                    Fatty acids are classified into saturated and unsaturated based on the number of carbon-carbon double bonds (Figure 2).
