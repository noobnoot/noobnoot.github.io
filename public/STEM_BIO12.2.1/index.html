                Eating is part of your everyday life. The carbohydrates in your food are broken down into <b>glucose</b>, which your cells use as their main energy source. This notion connects directly to biochemistry.
            </p>
            <boxed-quote>
                <p><b>Biochemistry</b> is the branch of science that studies the chemical processes and substances that occur within living organisms.</p>
            </boxed-quote>
            <p>
                Since our bodies are made up of billions of cells, and cells are built out of molecules, biochemistry focuses on these <b>biological molecules</b>—the ingredients of life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Among these, a group of large molecules called the <b>macromolecules</b> plays the biggest role. These are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Carbohydrates</b></li>
                <li><b>Proteins</b></li>
                <li><b>Lipids</b></li>
                <li><b>Nucleic Acids</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this lesson, we deal with the simplest macromolecule, the <b>carbohydrate</b>.</p>

            <h1>Carbohydrates</h1>

            <p>
                Carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids are made of <b>polymers</b>.
            </p>
            <boxed-quote>
                <p>A <b>polymer</b> is a large molecule composed of many repeating smaller units called <b>monomers</b>.</p>
            </boxed-quote>
            <p>
                For <b>carbohydrates</b>, the monomers (building blocks) are <b>monosaccharides</b> (also called "simple sugars").
            </p>
            <boxed-quote>
                <p><b>Carbohydrates</b> are the simplest biomolecules, often called "hydrates of carbon" because their composition follows a basic pattern: C, H, and O in the ratio 1:2:1 (or CH<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
            </boxed-quote>
            <p>
                The most important of them is <b>glucose</b>, which is the primary energy source for all living cells. Other monosaccharides include <b>fructose</b> (from fruits and honey), and <b>galactose</b> (from milk).
            </p>
