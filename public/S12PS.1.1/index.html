                Have you ever wondered why things fall, how electricity powers your phone, or what everything around you is made of? That’s exactly what Physical Science helps you explore.
            </p>
            <p>
                Physical Science is all about understanding the non-living parts of our world—from the tiniest atom to the vastness of space. It's a science that explains how things work and why they happen the way they do.

                    <b>Physical Science</b> is the branch of natural science that studies matter and energy and their interactions. It combines general knowledge from two major fields:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Chemistry</b>–the study of matter, its properties, structure, and how it changes.</li>
                    <li><b>Physics</b>–the study of forces, motion, energy, and the laws of nature.</li>
                </ul>
            </slidedown-box>
            <p>
                The semester's first half will delve deeply into <b>chemistry</b> and the origin of the elements.

            <h1>Basic Terms</h1>
            <p><b>Chemistry</b> is all about <b>matter</b>, which is anything that has mass and occupies space. Chemistry studies the composition and properties of matter, as well as the changes it undergoes.</p>
            <p>The following are some key terms important to learn about chemistry:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Atom</b>—the smallest unit of matter. It came from the Greek word “atomos,” which means “indivisible.”

                            <li><b>Neutrons</b>—particles of no charge found in the nucleus. The number of neutrons defines what kind of <i>isotope</i> this atom belongs to.</li>
                            <li><b>Electrons</b>—tiny, negatively charged particles circling the nuclei.</li>
