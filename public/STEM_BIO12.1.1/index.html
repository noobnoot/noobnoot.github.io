                    Going back 4.5 billion years, the Earth had no oxygen-rich atmosphere. Extreme volcanic activity was common, and the oceans were filled with simple chemical compounds. Lightning, heat, and extreme UV radiation created a volatile environment that set the stage for the emergence of life.

                    Once the first life forms emerged, Earth’s conditions continued to change. Scientists have developed several theories to explain how life continued, survived, and transformed.

                        <p><b>Biogenesis</b> states that living organisms can only arise from other organisms. This concept directly contradicts the earlier idea of spontaneous generation, which claims that life “emerges” from non-living matter. The principle of biogenesis was supported by a series of experiments, including those conducted by Francesco Redi.</p>

                        <p>In the 1700s, <b>John Needham</b> published his experiments of briefly boiling broth infused with animal matter in sealed flasks. After a few days, microbes “emerged” from the mixture, arguing against Redi’s experiment.</p>
                        <p><b>Lazarro Spllanzani</b> refuted Needham’s results by boiling the water longer and separating two mixtures in (1) an unsealed and (2) sealed flask. His results contradicted Needham’s findings.</p>
                        <p><b>Louis Pasteur</b>, a French chemist, ended the debate by creating a series of flasks with long, twisted necks to store the boiled broth. The swan-necked flasks remained sterile while those exposed to air contaminated the broth with microbes. His experiments disproved the theory of spontaneous generation.</p>
