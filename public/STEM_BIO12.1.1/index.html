                <b>Biology</b> is the scientific study of life and living organisms. It covers everything from microscopic bacteria to complex plants and animals, including humans. Through biology, we explore one of the universe’s mysteries: life.

                    Going back 4.5 billion years, the Earth had no oxygen-rich atmosphere. Extreme volcanic activity was common, and the oceans were filled with simple chemical compounds. Lightning, heat, and extreme UV radiation created a volatile environment that set the stage for the emergence of life.

                <h1>Origin of Life</h1>
                <p>
                    Over time, scientists and philosophers have proposed several ideas to explain how life might have started:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Creationism</b> claims that a divine or supernatural being created all life forms.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Abiogenesis</b> claims that the origin of the first living organisms came from nonliving matter. It proposed that simple organic molecules gradually combined to create the first primitive single-celled organism (referred to as the <i>universal common ancestor</i>).

                        <p class="subtitle"><b>Warning:</b> <i>Spontaneous generation</i> is <b>NOT</b> abiogenesis. Spontaneous generation is an old, disproven belief that life continuously and suddenly appears from non-living materials.

                <p>
                    Once the first life forms emerged, Earth’s conditions continued to change. Scientists have developed several theories to explain how life continued, survived, and transformed.
                </p>

                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Catastrophism</b> suggests that sudden, violent events shaped Earth’s life. Mass extinctions gave way for new life to evolve and adapt.</li>
                    <li><b>Evolution</b> explains how living organisms changed via natural selection and genetic variation. It explains diversity and adaptation of species.</li>
