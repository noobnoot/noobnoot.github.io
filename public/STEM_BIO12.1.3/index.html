                <p>In this lesson, you are expected to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Characterize the phases of the cell cycle and their control points (<b>STEM_BIO11/12-Id-f-6</b>).</li>
                    <li>Discuss crossing over and recombination in meiosis (<b>STEM_BIO11/12-Id-f-8</b>).</li>
                    <li>Explain the significance or applications of mitosis/meiosis (<b>STEM_BIO11/12-Id-f-9</b>).

            </slidedown-box>
            <p>
                These everyday events are possible because the cells in your body are constantly dividing and replacing old or damaged cells. The secret behind this process lies in the <b>cell cycle</b>.
            </p>
            <boxed-quote>
                <p>The <b>cell cycle</b> is a series of events involving cell growth and division that produces two new daughter cells.</p>
            </boxed-quote>
            <p>
                The cell cycle has two major stages: <b>Interphase</b> (where the cell grows and prepares) and <b>M-phase</b> (where the cell divides).

                    The interphase is divided into three sub-stages:
                </p>
                <ol class="marginless-list"> 
                    <li>
                        <h3>G1 Phase (Gap 1)</h3>
                        <p>The cell grows in size, produces proteins, and does its normal functions. A checkpoint here ensures conditions are suitable for the DNA replication.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>S Phase (Synthesis)</h3>
                        <p>The cell replicates its DNA, producing identical copies of chromosomes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>G2 Phase (Gap 2)</h3>
                        <p>Further growth and preparation for cell division. Organelles and enzymes needed for division are produced. Final checkpoint ensures DNA replication is accurate.</p>
                    </li>

                    <p>If DNA is damaged or conditions aren't favorable, the cell enters a resting state. If the damage is too severe, they undergo <b>apoptosis</b> (programmed cell death).</p>

            <section header="M-phase">
                <h1>M-phase</h1>
                <p>In this stage, the cell actively divides. It has two pathways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Mitosis</h3>
                        <p>Mitosis is the process by which a single cell divides to produce <b>two genetically identical daughter cells</b>. It is used for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Meiosis</h3>
                        <p>Meiosis is a special type of cell division in <b>reproductive cells</b> (e.g., sperm and egg). It reduces the chromosome number by half, producing <b>four unique daughter cells</b>, each with genetic variation.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>For each pathways, the cell undergoes four phases: (1) <b>prophase</b>, (2) <b>metaphase</b>, (3) <b>anaphase</b>, and (4) <b>telophase</b>.</p>
