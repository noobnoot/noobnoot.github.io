            <p>
                Assume you are driving on a highway at a speed of 50 km/h. How many hours will it take you to reach a destination 120 km away?
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve questions like this, we resort to the branch of physics that deals with motion—<b>kinematics</b>.
            </p>
            <boxed-quote>
                <p><b>Kinematics</b> is the study of motion. It focuses on measurable quantities such as distance, speed, and acceleration.</p>
            </boxed-quote>
            <p>
                To know the answer to the problem, we have to understand the concept of distance, time, and speed.

                <h1>Distance and Speed</h1>
                <p>When describing motion with kinematics, you must know how far an object is.</p>
                <boxed-quote>
                    <p>
                        <b>Distance</b> ($d$) is the total length of the path traveled by an object. Meanwhile, <b>displacement</b> ($\vec{d}$) tells you the change of distance (with direction considered).
                    </p>
                </boxed-quote>
                <p>Dividing distance and displacement by time $t$ gives you speed and velocity, respectively.</p>
                <boxed-quote>
                    <p>
                        <b>Speed</b> ($v$) is the rate at which an object covers distance. Similarly, <b>velocity</b> ($\vec{v}$) is the rate of change of displacement over time with direction. They are defined as:
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"> 
                        $v = \frac{d}{t}$ (for distance) or $\vec{v} = \frac{\vec{d}}{t}$ (for displacement) 
                    </p>
                </boxed-quote>
                <p>So, how do we solve the motorcycle problem?</p>
                <p>The problem defines distance $d=120 \text{ km}$ and $v=50 \text{ km/h}$, solving for time $t$. Using the speed formula, we can solve for time $t$:</p>
                <p>$$v = \frac{d}{t} \to 50 \text{ km/h} = \frac{120 \text{ km}}{t} \to t = \frac{120 \text{ km}}{50 \text{ km/h}}=\boxed{2.4 \text{ h}}$$</p>
                <p>So, you still have 2.4 hours to reach the destination.</p>
                <boxed-quote>
                    <p>An object moving on an $x$-axis (like a motorcycle coursing through a straight road) is considered <b>horizontal motion</b>.</p>
                </boxed-quote>
                <p>Other examples of horizontal motion include a ball rolling on the floor, a car speeding up on a highway, or you jogging towards school.</p>
