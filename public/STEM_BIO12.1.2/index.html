            <p>
                The human body is made up of many specialized cells, each with a specific role. For example, epithelial cells protect surfaces of the body, bone cells provide support, immune cells fight infection, and blood cells transport nutrients and oxygen.

            <p>Despite their diversity, all cells, from bacteria to humans, share basic features.</p>

                <p>The discovery of the cell opened the gates for the <b>Cell Theory</b>—the fundamental principle in biology that explains the structure and function of all living organisms in terms of cells. There are two main theories.</p>

                    Most prokaryotes have a protective cell wall made of <b>peptidoglycan</b>, a long chain of carbohydrates. The cell wall maintains the cell shape and prevents it from dehydration, while the capsule helps it stick to surfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some prokaryotes also have <b>flagella</b> (for movement), <b>pili</b> (for sharing DNA during conjugation), and <b>fimbriae</b> (for attaching to host cells).
