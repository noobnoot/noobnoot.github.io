                Hi!
                <br><br>
                We just wanted to say thank you for being such a wonderful student. We know our time together was short, but we're genuinely glad we got to meet you (like, seriously).
                <br><br>
                As you head off to whatever adventures lie ahead, remember this: you are the author of your own storyâ€”so don't let anyone else hold the pen.
                <br><br>
                You'll have days when you doubt yourself (we all do), but please, don't ever lose your courage to explore, learn, and grow. Just because you're not great at one thing doesn't mean you won't be amazing at something else.
                <br><br>
                So that's it. Be kind. Be curious. Be you.
                <br><br>
                And above all... don't forget to cherish your friends. They are the greatest treasures in life.
                <br><br>
                <i>Your *ahem* loving practice teachers,
                <br>
                Sir Joren and Sir Nicoles<br></i>
